# Persisting State in Jotai

The Jotai package also includes a **jotai/utils** bundle. These functions add support for
persisting an atom’s state in localStorage (or URL hash), hydrating an atom’s state during
server-side rendering, creating an atom with a set function including Redux-like reducers
and action types, and much more!

This toggle will be persisted between user sessions via localStorage.
